Worked on the development of 499Store official React Native-based e-commerce mobile application.

•Developed the my-order section, return & refund (used xRazorpay) pages for the application and reduced customer complaints, which were unable to return products.

•Handled all the return orders with the nimbus APIs. Also implemented a feature to instantiate the refund after the returned product had been received and verified.

•Added new features to the cart page like (custom buttons to increase and decrease the quantity of a product) which provides great customer experience and makes the application more user-friendly.

Created a Whatsapp automation software to send messages to thousands of customers at a time. Which helps to decrease the response time by 90%.
